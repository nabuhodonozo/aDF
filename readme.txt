## 🔄 UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS - READ CAREFULLY!!!!!!!

### ⚠️⚠️⚠️ **BEFORE YOU START - IMPORTANT WARNING: ** ⚠️⚠️⚠️
**DO NOT DELETE YOUR ENTIRE WTF FOLDER!**  
Following these instructions incorrectly can make you lose ALL settings for ALL your addons.

### **STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE:**

#### **1. EXIT WORLD OF WARCRAFT COMPLETELY**
- Close WoW to desktop (don't just `/reload`)
- This allows SavedVariables to save properly

#### **2. FIND YOUR CORRECT WTF FOLDER**
Navigate to **ONE** of these paths:

**For Vanilla WoW 1.12.1 **
World of Warcraft/WTF/Account/[YOUR_ACCOUNT]/SavedVariables/

*(Replace `[YOUR_ACCOUNT]` with your actual account/email name)*

#### **3. DELETE ONLY THESE 2 FILES:**
Inside the `SavedVariables/` folder, find and delete:
- 📄 `aDF.lua` ← DELETE THIS ONE
- 📄 `aDF.lua.bak` ← DELETE THIS TOO (if it exists)

**DO NOT DELETE ANY OTHER FILES IN THIS FOLDER!**

#### **4. INSTALL NEW aDF v4.3:**
1. Delete old addon folder: `Interface/AddOns/aDF/`
2. Extract new v4.3 files to: `Interface/AddOns/aDF/`

#### **5. LAUNCH WORLD OF WARCRAFT**
- Start WoW normally
- aDF v4.3 will create fresh configuration files
- Use `/adf options` to configure your settings

### **❌ WHAT NOT TO DO:**
- ❌ **NEVER delete the entire WTF folder** (this would delete ALL addon settings)
- ❌ Don't just overwrite old files (causes conflicts)
- ❌ Don't skip deleting SavedVariables (will cause errors)
- ❌ Don't update while WoW is running

### **✅ WHAT TO DO IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE:**
If you accidentally delete wrong files:
1. Check Windows Recycle Bin
2. Restore any non-aDF files you deleted
3. Other addons will recreate their settings when you launch WoW

A complete overhaul of the debuff tracking system, optimized for raid utility and clarity.

## ✨ Main Features & Changes

### **Core System Rework**
- **Priority-Based Sorting:** Debuffs are now ordered via a customizable priority list (see line 142) instead of alphabetically.
- **Extensible Architecture:** The code has been fully refactored for better readability and future maintenance.

### **UI & Display Enhancements**
- **Third Debuff Row:** Added a new, fully functional row for tracking additional debuffs (e.g., weapon procs, set bonuses). The system is designed to be easily extended for more rows or even buff tracking.
- **Resistance Display:** The feature to view target resistances has been restored.
- **Visual Overhaul:** Updated the options panel and debuff frames with a cleaner, more organized visual style.
- **Armor Box Background Toggle:** Added an option to show/hide the background of the armor break display.

### **Options Panel Revamp**
- The configuration panel (`adf options`) has been completely rebuilt with separated, logical sections for easier navigation.

### **Quality of Life & Anti-Spam**
- **Announcement Toggle:** Added an option to enable/disable `/say` announcements for armor breaks to prevent chat spam during raids.

### **Technical Improvements**
- **Full Code Reorganization:** The entire codebase has been restructured to improve legibility and facilitate future contributions.
