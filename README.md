# aDF - Amor/debuff Frame for Turtle WoW

### 🔄 **UPDATING FROM OLDER VERSIONS? READ THIS!** v1.0-v4.3

aDF v4.2.1+ is a **complete codebase rewrite** with different data structures. You **MUST** clean your SavedVariables:

#### Step-by-Step Update Guide:
1. **Exit WoW completely** (to desktop, not just `/reload`)
2. Navigate to your WTF folder: <br>
World of Warcraft/Turtle WoW/WTF/Account/[YOUR_ACCOUNT]/SavedVariables/
3. Delete **ONLY** these 2 files:
- `aDF.lua`
- `aDF.lua.bak` (if exists)
4. Install new aDF v4.3 to `Interface/AddOns/aDF/`
5. Launch WoW - fresh config will be created

**⚠️ WARNING:** Never delete your entire WTF folder! This would lose ALL addon settings.

### CRITICAL CLEANUP STEP ⚠️: <br>

Search for any other aDF.lua files in your SavedVariables folders. They can sometimes be orphaned in server-specific or even character-specific paths, like:
World of Warcraft/Turtle WoW/WTF/Account/[YOUR_ACCOUNT]/[Server]/[YOUR_CHARACTER]/SavedVariables
Delete all of them to ensure a clean reset.
